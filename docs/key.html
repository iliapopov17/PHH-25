          Here, you can see the <mark>sentiment analysis</mark> results for a collection of Kazakhstani news articles related to general health.
          In the middle of the plot, there’s a clear change in the pattern. The <mark>dip in 2020</mark> marks the onset of COVID,
          while the <mark>rise just before</mark> that is linked to promotional coverage of the healthcare reform.

          One particularly interesting finding is that during the COVID period, people actually reported
          <mark>better</mark> health perceptions than in other times. COVID happened to coincide with a major healthcare
          reform in Kazakhstan, launched in mid-2019 — about six months earlier.
          <br><br>
          To separate the effects of COVID from the reform, we used a <mark>difference-in-differences</mark> approach.
          This method tests whether an external event changes a trend we would otherwise expect in the data.
          Our results show that it wasn’t COVID itself, but <mark>most likely the reform</mark>, that shifted how people perceived their health.
          Still, during the peak of the pandemic, the <em>QuantCovid</em> coefficient showed a surprising uptick in the long-term trend.
          Why? We can only speculate. One explanation: <i>«I didn’t die today — that’s already a success»</i>.
          Another: reporting better health may have been a coping mechanism — people reassuring themselves that they were healthy.

          Another interesting finding comes from a different dependent variable — <mark>attitudes toward private healthcare</mark>.
          In regions with <mark>below-average life expectancy</mark>, these attitudes actually worsened after the reform.
          It seems that people who expect to live shorter lives than the average Kazakhstani feel that private medicine
          won’t make much difference for them.
